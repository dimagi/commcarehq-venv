eGenix mx Base Distribution for Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Installation
-------------------

In order to build and install the source distribution, run 

    python setup.py install

Then change to some other directory and try to import the packages:

$ cd ~
$ python
Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, Jan  9 2009, 21:28:52)
[GCC 4.2.1 (SUSE Linux)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from mx.DateTime import now
>>> print now()
2009-02-26 11:00:03.24
>>>                            

Note that trying this from the installation directory will cause
Python to pick up the source tree packages which do not contain the
compiled binaries.  This will likely fail with strange error messages.


Prebuilt Installation
---------------------

If you have downloaded a prebuilt distribution archive, the
installation is basically the same as for the source installation,
only that setup.py will automatically skip the build process.

In order to build and install the prebuilt distribution, run 

    python setup.py install

and then test the setup as explained for the source installation.
