#
# NOTE: These defines are only necessary in case Python hasn't checked
#       for the specific C lib APIs during the ./configure step. All of them
#       are checked on Unix starting with Python 1.5.2. On other patforms
#       you may have to uncomment these by hand:
#
# Uncomment this line if you have the strftime() C lib API on your platform
#	-DHAVE_STRFTIME \
#
# Uncomment this line if you have the strptime() C lib API on your platform
#	-DHAVE_STRPTIME \
#
# Uncomment this line if you have the timegm() C lib API on your platform
#	-DHAVE_TIMEGM \
#
# mxDateTime can use its own API for querying the current time from
# the OS, or reuse the Python time.time() function. The latter is more
# portable, but slower. Define the following symbol to use the faster
# native API.
#
#	-DUSE_FAST_GETCURRENTTIME \
#
# mxDateTime can use real time APIs if the system provides them.
#
#        -DHAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME -lrt \
#
# mxDateTime has experimental support for subclassable types which
# were introduced in Python 2.2a1. Enable the following symbol to
# make the DateTimeType subclassable.
#
#	-DWANT_SUBCLASSABLE_TYPES \
#
	mxDateTime.c
