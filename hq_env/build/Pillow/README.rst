Pillow
======

.. Note:: Pillow >= 2.0.0 supports Python versions: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3; Pillow < 2.0.0 supports Python versions: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7.

Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.

Introduction
------------

The fork author's goal is to foster active development of PIL through:

- Continuous integration testing via Travis-CI
- Publicized development activity on GitHub
- Regular releases to the Python Packaging Index
- Solicitation for community contributions and involvement on Imaging-SIG

Why a fork?
-----------

PIL is not setuptools compatible. Please see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-August/006480.html for a more detailed explanation. Also, PIL's current bi-yearly (or greater) release schedule is too infrequent to accomodate the large number and frequency of issues reported.

What about image code bugs?
---------------------------

Please report any non-packaging related issues here first:

- https://bitbucket.org/effbot/pil-2009-raclette/issues 

Then open a ticket here:

- https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues

and provide a link to the first ticket so we can track the issue(s) upstream.

.. Note:: Prior to Pillow 2.0.0, very few image code changes were made. Pillow 2.0.0 adds Python 3 support and includes many bug fixes from around the internet.

Documentation
-------------

The API documentation included with PIL has been converted (from HTML generated by pythondoc) to reStructured text (via pandoc) and is now `hosted by readthedocs.org <http://pillow.readthedocs.org>`_. This is a work in progress: in order to re-generate new API documentation, either `pythondoc <http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc.htm>`_ will have to be run again or the pythondoc functionality must be converted to Sphinx.

Community
---------

Pillow needs you! Please help us maintain PIL via:

- GitHub Code (https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow)
- Freenode Chat (irc://irc.freenode.net#pil)
- Image-SIG Discussion (http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/image-sig)

Platform support
----------------

Current platform support for Pillow. Binary distributions are contributed for each release on a volunteer basis, but the source should compile and run everywhere platform support is listed. In general, we aim to support all current versions of Linux, OS X, and Windows.

.. Note:: Contributors please test on your platform, edit this document and send a pull request

    Introduction
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities
    to your Python environment.  This library provides extensive file
    format support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful
    image processing capabilities.

    This source kit has been built and tested with Python 2.0 and newer,
    on Windows, Mac OS X, and major Unix platforms.  Large parts of the
    library also work on 1.5.2 and 1.6.

    The main distribution site for this software is:

            http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

    That site also contains information about free and commercial support
    options, PIL add-ons, answers to frequently asked questions, and more.

    For a list of changes in this release, see the CHANGES document.

    0. If you're in a hurry, try this:

            $ tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
            $ cd Imaging-1.1.7
            $ python setup.py install

       If you prefer to know what you're doing, read on.


    1. Prerequisites.

       If you need any of the features described below, make sure you
       have the necessary libraries before building PIL.

       feature              library
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       JPEG support         libjpeg (6a or 6b)

                            http://www.ijg.org
                            http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
                            ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/

       PNG support          zlib (1.2.3 or later is recommended)

                            http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

       OpenType/TrueType    freetype2 (2.3.9 or later is recommended)
       support              
                            http://www.freetype.org
                            http://freetype.sourceforge.net  

       CMS support          littleCMS (1.1.5 or later is recommended)
       support              
                            http://www.littlecms.com/

       If you have a recent Linux version, the libraries provided with the
       operating system usually work just fine.  If some library is
       missing, installing a prebuilt version (jpeg-devel, zlib-devel,
       etc) is usually easier than building from source.  For example, for
       Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic), you can install the following libraries:

           sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
           sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
           sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
           sudo apt-get install liblcms1-dev

       If you're using Mac OS X, you can use the 'fink' tool to install
       missing libraries (also see the Mac OS X section below).

       Similar tools are available for many other platforms.


    2. To build under Python 1.5.2, you need to install the stand-alone
       version of the distutils library:

           http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

       You can fetch distutils 1.0.2 from the Python source repository:
       
           svn export http://svn.python.org/projects/python/tags/Distutils-1_0_2/Lib/distutils/

       For newer releases, the distutils library is included in the
       Python standard library.

       NOTE: Version 1.1.7 is not fully compatible with 1.5.2.  Some
       more recent additions to the library may not work, but the core
       functionality is available.
       

    3. If you didn't build Python from sources, make sure you have
       Python's build support files on your machine.  If you've down-
       loaded a prebuilt package (e.g. a Linux RPM), you probably
       need additional developer packages.  Look for packages named
       "python-dev", "python-devel", or similar.  For example, for
       Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic), use the following command:

           sudo apt-get install python-dev


    4. When you have everything you need, unpack the PIL distribution
       (the file Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz) in a suitable work directory:

            $ cd MyExtensions # example
            $ gunzip Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
            $ tar xvf Imaging-1.1.7.tar


    5. Build the library.  We recommend that you do an in-place build,
       and run the self test before installing.

            $ cd Imaging-1.1.7
            $ python setup.py build_ext -i
            $ python selftest.py

       During the build process, the setup.py will display a summary
       report that lists what external components it found.  The self-
       test will display a similar report, with what external components
       the tests found in the actual build files:

            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            PIL 1.1.7 SETUP SUMMARY
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            *** TKINTER support not available (Tcl/Tk 8.5 libraries needed)
            --- JPEG support available
            --- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
            --- FREETYPE support available
            ----------------------------------------------------------------

       Make sure that the optional components you need are included.

       If the build script won't find a given component, you can edit the
       setup.py file and set the appropriate ROOT variable.  For details,
       see instructions in the file.

       If the build script finds the component, but the tests cannot
       identify it, try rebuilding *all* modules:

            $ python setup.py clean
            $ python setup.py build_ext -i


    6. If the setup.py and selftest.py commands finish without any
       errors, you're ready to install the library:

            $ python setup.py install

       (depending on how Python has been installed on your machine,
       you might have to log in as a superuser to run the 'install'
       command, or use the 'sudo' command to run 'install'.)


    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additional notes for Mac OS X
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    On Mac OS X you will usually install additional software such as
    libjpeg or freetype with the "fink" tool, and then it ends up in
    "/sw".  If you have installed the libraries elsewhere, you may have
    to tweak the "setup.py" file before building.


    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additional notes for Windows
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    On Windows, you need to tweak the ROOT settings in the "setup.py"
    file, to make it find the external libraries.  See comments in the
    file for details.

    Make sure to build PIL and the external libraries with the same
    runtime linking options as was used for the Python interpreter
    (usually /MD, under Visual Studio).


    Note that most Python distributions for Windows include libraries
    compiled for Microsoft Visual Studio.  You can get the free Express
    edition of Visual Studio from:

        http://www.microsoft.com/Express/

    To build extensions using other tool chains, see the "Using
    non-Microsoft compilers on Windows" section in the distutils handbook:

        http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/non-ms-compilers.html

    For additional information on how to build extensions using the
    popular MinGW compiler, see:

        http://mingw.org (compiler)
        http://sebsauvage.net/python/mingw.html (build instructions)
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32 (prebuilt libraries)
