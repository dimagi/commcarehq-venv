Raven is a Python client for `Sentry <http://www.getsentry.com/>`_. It provides
full out-of-the-box support for many of the popular frameworks, including
Django, and Flask. Raven also includes drop-in support for any WSGI-compatible
web application.

Your application doesn't live on the web? No problem! Raven is easy to use in
any Python application.

**Raven 1.0 requires at least version 2.0 of Sentry to be installed on the server**
