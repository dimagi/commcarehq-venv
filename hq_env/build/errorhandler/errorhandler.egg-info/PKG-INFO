Description: ============
        ErrorHandler
        ============
        
        This is a handler for the python standard logging framework that can
        be used to tell whether messages have been logged at or above a
        certain level.
        
        This can be useful when wanting to ensure that no errors have been
        logged before committing data back to a database.
        
        As an example, first, you set up the error handler:
        
        >>> from errorhandler import ErrorHandler
        >>> e = ErrorHandler()
        
        Then you can log and check the handler at any point to see if it has
        been triggered:
        
        >>> e.fired
        False
        >>> from logging import getLogger
        >>> logger = getLogger()
        >>> logger.error('an error')
        >>> e.fired
        True
        
        You can use the `fired` attribute to only perform actions when no
        errors have been logged:
        
        >>> if e.fired:
        ...   print "Not updating files as errors have occurred"
        Not updating files as errors have occurred
