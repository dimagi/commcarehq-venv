3.3.0 / 2011-06-20

  in C based on  http-parser from Ryan Dahl.
- Fix UnboundLocalError
- Sync oauth with last python-oauth2 (fix POST & encoding issues)
- Improve sending

Breaking changes:
+++++++++++++++++

- Headers is an IOrderdDict object now, wich means by default you can
  get any headers case insensitively using get or headers[key], as a
  result the method **iget** has been removed.

3.2.1 / 2011-03-22
------------------

- Fix sending on linux.

3.2 / 2011-02-18
----------------

- Some deep rewrite of the client. Requests and Connections are now
  maintened in their own instances, so we don't rely on client instance
  to close or release the connection Also we don't pass local variable
  to handle a request. At the end each requests are more isolated and we are
  fully threadsafe.
- Improve error report.
- Handle case where the connection is closed but the OS still accept
  sending. From the man: "When  the message does not fit into the send
  buffer of the socket, send() normally blocks, unless th socket has
  been placed in nonblocking I/O mode.""" . Spotted by loftus on irc.
  Thanks.

Breaking changes:
+++++++++++++++++

- Rewrite filters handling. We now pass a request instance to the
  on_request filters. If a request filter return a response, we stop to
  perform here. response filters accept now the response and request
  instances as arguments. There is no more on_connect filters (it was a
  bad idea)
- Proxy support. Proxies are now supported by passing the argument
  "use_proxy=True" to client, request and resources objects.

  connections are now closed after a time.

  code.

2.3.0 / 2010-11-25
------------------
 - Refactored Http Connections management (reuse connections).
   restkit.pool is now replaced by restkit.conn module. SimplePool has
   been replaced by TConnectionManager (threadsafe). Now by default all
   connections are reusing connections using TConnectionManager (10
   connections per route).
 - Improved Gevent & Eventlet support
 - Added an ``decompress`` option to ``request`` function and ``Resource``
   instance to decompress the body or not. By default it's true.
 - Added ``params_dict`` to keywords arguments of ``Resource`` instances
   methods. Allows you to pass any argument to the query.
 - Fix response 100-continue
