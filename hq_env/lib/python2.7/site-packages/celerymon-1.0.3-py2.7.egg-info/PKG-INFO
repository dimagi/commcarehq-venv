        Installation
        =============
        
        You can install ``celerymon`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
        or from source.
        
        To install using ``pip``,::
        
            $ pip install celerymon
        
        To install using ``easy_install``,::
        
            $ easy_install celerymon
        
        Downloading and installing from source
        --------------------------------------
        
        Download the latest version of ``celerymon`` from
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celerymon/
        
        You can install it by doing the following,::
        
            $ tar xvfz celerymon-0.0.0.tar.gz
            $ cd celerymon-0.0.0
            $ python setup.py build
            # python setup.py install # as root
        
        Using the development version
        ------------------------------
        
        You can clone the repository by doing the following::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/celery/celerymon.git
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Running the monitor
        -------------------
        
        Start celery with the ``--events`` option on, so celery sends events for
        celerymon to capture::
        
            $ python manage.py celeryd -E
        
        Run the monitor server::
        
            $ python manage.py celerymon
        
        
        However, in production you probably want to run the monitor in the
        background, as a daemon:: 
        
            $ python manage.py celerymon --detach
        
        
        For a complete listing of the command line arguments available, with a short
        description, you can use the help command::
        
            $ python manage.py help celerymon
        
        
        Now you can visit the webserver celerymon starts by going to:
